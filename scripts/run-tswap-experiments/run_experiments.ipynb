    "1.\t`number` - The number of agents involved in the experiment.\n",
    "2.\t`collision` - The total number of agent collisions, which is 0 for TSWAP algorithm (because this algorithm guaratees collision free movement).\n",
    "3.\t`collision_obst` - The total number of collisions between agents and obstacles, also 0.\n",
    "4.\t`flowtime` - The total flowtime of the solution, representing the cumulative time all agents take to reach their goals.\n",
    "5.\t`makespan` - The makespan of the solution, representing the time taken until the last agent reaches its goal.\n",
    "6.\t`runtime` - The execution time of the TSWAP algorithm for this experiment, recorded in seconds.\n",
    "7.\t`success` - The success rate of the experiment, where 100 represents success (solved * 100).\n",
    "8.\t`sum_of_dists` - The total distance traveled by all agents, calculated as the sum of individual agent travel distances.\n",
